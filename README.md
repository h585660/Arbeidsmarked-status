# 🇳🇴 Norwegian Job Market Status 📊

Welcome to my React app that tracks the status of available jobs in Norway by sector! 🚀

## Motivation

So, here's the deal: I should be job hunting, but instead, I ended up creating this React app. Classic case of a programmer avoiding writing a CV, am I right? 😅 But hey, what can I say? Coding is my passion! 💻

## What it Does

This app lets you explore the current job market in Norway based on different sectors. Just click on a button to choose a sector, and voila! You'll see a graph showing the trend of available positions over the years. 📈

## Purpose

Sure, it might seem like I'm procrastinating, but hear me out! This app is all about simplifying things for folks who are looking to enter the job market. Instead of spending hours analyzing data, they can quickly see which sectors are thriving and which ones are on the decline. It's like a cheat code for job seekers! 😉

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning! In the future, I plan to make this app even more detailed and informative. Stay tuned for updates! 🛠️
